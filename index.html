<p>thank you.</p>

<p>the last year has been rough for me. i lost a bestfriend to suicide, my depression and anxiety getting worse, ignorant and emotionally
damaging parents, my lack of friends and of a positive social life.</p>

<p>most people bully me. they point and laugh at me, even though i fake
my appearance. i doubt my real self is the solution here in hell.
i'd get called a faggot. it's happened once, at least to my face,
with the sender not aware of me being gay.</p>

<p>i am barely holding on still, with the idea of ending it all always
present, but no actual intent of doing so. i feel alone. unimportant.
forgettable. useless. isolated.</p>

<p>maybe it's because im a furry. maybe because it's because im gay.
maybe it's just all not worth it. but maybe it's normal for a highschooler.
or maybe, im just lying to myself.</p>

<p>thank you. thank you for being here for me.</p>
